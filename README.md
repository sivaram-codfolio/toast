üì¶ **Installation**  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sivaram-codfolio/toast.git
cd toast
npm install
```


üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**  
To use the Toast notification system in your React application, follow these steps:

1. Import the useToast hook in your component:

```typescript
import { useToast } from "@app/hooks";
```

2. Use the useToast hook to show toast notifications:

```typescript
const ToastComponent = () => {
  const showToast = useToast();

  const successToast = () => {
    showToast("‚úÖ Success! Your changes have been saved.", { variant: "success", duration: 3000 });
  };

  const errorToast = () => {
    showToast("‚ùå Error! Something went wrong.", { variant: "error" });
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={successToast}>Show Success Toast</button>
      <button onClick={errorToast}>Show Error Toast</button>
    </>
  );
};
```


üñåÔ∏è **Customization**  
You can customize the toast‚Äôs appearance and behavior by modifying the toast.tsx file. Tailwind CSS classes can be updated directly in the component, or you can override them in a custom CSS file for more flexibility.

Here‚Äôs an example for custom configurations:

```bash
const customToast = (message: string) => {
  showToast(message, { variant: "info", duration: 5000 });
};
```
